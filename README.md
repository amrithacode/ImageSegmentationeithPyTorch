Loaded a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problem(for e.g, Unet) using segmentation model pytorch library. Used Segmentation Dataset and a custom dataset class for Image-mask dataset. Applied segmentation augmentation to augment images as well as its masks. For image-mask augmentation used albumentation library. Plotted the image-Mask pair.Ctreated train function and evaluator function which was used to write training loop. Used training loop to train the model. SKILLS:
